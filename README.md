# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates an uncommon case of a ZeroDivisionError in Python. The error is masked by the conditional check for 'a' being zero but occurs when 'a' is not zero and 'b' is zero. The solution highlights how to correct it by handling all potential scenarios where division by zero can occur.
